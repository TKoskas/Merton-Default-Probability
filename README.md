# Credit Default Probability Calculation using the Merton Model

This repository implements the Merton model to estimate Credit Default Probability (PD). The Merton model calculates the likelihood of a firm's assets falling below its liabilities at maturity, indicating default. 

## Features
- Python implementation of the Merton model.
- Calculates PD based on asset values, volatility, debt levels, and the risk-free rate.
- Uses NumPy and SciPy for efficient numerical calculations.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TKoskas/Merton-Default-Probability
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```




## Usage
To calculate the PD, run the script with appropriate parameters:

```bash
python merton_pd_calculator.py

```
